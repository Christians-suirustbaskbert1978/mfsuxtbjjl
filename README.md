Dude, did you watch Borderline yet? Just finished it and I'm kinda all over the place here. I mean, this movie is a full-on roller-coaster, like whoa! ðŸ¤¯ It's like you're trying to figure out life and then they just drop this wild plot twist and you're just sitting there like Seriously? 

Itâ€™s so intense that most of the time I had to remind myself to breathe. You know what I mean? That kind of intense. And the irony? Ugh, itâ€™s laid on real thick. Like biting into one of those lemons from the grove that I forgot to pick â€“ sour and just a little satisfying. ðŸ˜‚  

> Honestly, why did I even download the movie? I swear I only meant to watch the movie for half an hour before bed, but then it just...sucked me in. You know when it feels like a mix between watching someone's trainwreck of a life and feeling like you're maybe seeing a bit of yourself? Itâ€™s that uncanny valley but in emotional terms. Maybe I've just started caring too much about fictional lives. Who knows anymore?

The characters, man, theyâ€™re so all over the place that I can't even tell if theyâ€™re supposed to be lovable or just plain messed up. Like, the director must've had a field day figuring out how to mash so much chaos into 2 hours. Kudos on that front, though. Wild experience.

Anyway, the exhaustion is hitting, but you gotta watch it for the ride, if nothing else. And if non-stop drama is your thing, then this movie got your back, haha. Let's catch up soon and compare mental notes or just marvel at how life feels like a never-ending drama sometimes. Catch ya later!
